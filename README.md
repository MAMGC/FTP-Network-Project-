# FTP-Network-Project-
Implement multiple clients that run on different devices to connect to FTP server. 
➢ FTP uses two TCP connections for communication (2 ports), One to pass control information (ex: username &amp; password) and the other for data connection to send the data files to client. 
➢ FTP Server will have 2 files, the first to save the authorized Clients with their username &amp; password, and the second will save the dirs. that allowed to each client (minimum 4 clients and for each client 3 dirs. and into each dir. 3 files).
